It perfectly fitted, the last project of the foundations of The Odin Project was my personal 'Endgegner'. I broke the rules and didn't code it by myself. I could'nt do it. I did know how to start, but would always hit a wall and I was probably the most frustrated I've been through the whole journey.

I decided to look for video tutorials, the forbidden source and coded along. It helped a bunch, but it would be a lie, if I'd say, I can now do it by myself. I will come back to this project.
